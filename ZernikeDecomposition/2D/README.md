#2D Zernike Decomposition/Reconstruction of an image
Has 3 executables:
- genarate_inputs - prepares parameters for calculating each Zernike polynomial
- boost_zernike - calculates the Zernike polynomialss for each input file
- decompose_reconstruct - handles image decomposition/reconstruction. The results for now are saved as raw binary matrix.
